  abstract = {The proliferation of relatively affordable off-the-shelf drones offers great opportunities for wildlife monitoring and conservation. Similarly the recent reduction in~the cost of thermal infrared cameras also offers new promise in this field, as they have the advantage over conventional RGB cameras of being able to distinguish animals based on their body heat and being able to detect animals at night. However, the use of drone-mounted thermal infrared cameras comes with several technical challenges. In this article, we address some of these issues, namely thermal contrast problems due to heat from the ground, absorption and emission of thermal infrared radiation by the atmosphere, obscuration by vegetation, and optimizing the flying height of drones for a best balance between covering a large area and being able to accurately image and identify animals of interest. We demonstrate the application of these methods with a case study using field data and make the first ever detection of the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) in thermal infrared data. We provide a web-tool so that the community can easily apply these techniques to other studies (http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/aricburk/uav\_calc/).},

  abstract = {Infrared spectroscopy probes the characteristic vibrational and rotational modes of chemical bonds in molecules to provide information about both the chemical composition and the bonding configuration of a sample. The significant advantage of the Infrared spectral technique is that it can be used with minimal consumables to simultaneously detect a large variety of chemical and biochemical species with high chemical specificity. To date, relatively large Fourier Transform (FT-IR) spectrometers employing variations of the Michelson interferometer have been successfully employed in space for various IR spectroscopy applications. However, FT-IR systems are mechanically complex, bulky (\&gt; 15 kg), and require considerable processing. This paper discusses the use of advanced integrated optics and smart optical coding techniques to significantly extend the performance of miniature IR spectrometers by several orders of magnitude in sensitivity. This can provide the next generation of compact, high-performance IR spectrometers with monolithically integrated optical systems for robust optical alignment. The entire module can weigh under 3 kg to minimize the mass penalty for space applications. Miniaturized IR spectrometers are versatile and very convenient for small and micro satellite based missions. They can be dedicated to the monitoring of the CO\textsubscript{2} in an Earth Observation mission, to Mars exobiology exploration, as well as to vital life support in manned space system; such as the cabin air quality and the quality of the recycled water supply.},

  abstract = {Robot-assisted natural disaster management is recently employed to aid human rescuers at diverse disaster sites. Due to its compactness and availability, drone has become an effective tool for searching survivors from confined space such as collapsed building or underground area. However, the current scope of research in this field is limited because the research tends to focus on increasing accuracy of 3d mapping, constructed by controlling quadrotor flight at disaster sites. Perceiving disaster environment is necessary for rescue mission, but finding victims at the earliest time is more critical for practical rescue operations. In this work, we propose an overall architecture for drone hardware that enables fast exploration of GPS-denied environment, and practical methods for victim detection are introduced. We employ DJI Matrice 100 and utilize hokuyo lidar for global mapping and Intel RealSense for local mapping. Our results show that fusing these sensors can assist rescuers to find victims of natural disaster in unknown environments, and the detection system is insensitive to illumination change.},

If absolute temperature measurements can be made with these cameras, they may be useful for non-contact monitoring of electrocautery-based vessel sealing, or other thermal surgical processes like thermal ablation of tumors. As a first step in evaluating the feasibility of optical medical thermometry with these new cameras, in this paper we explore how well thermal measurements can be made with them. These cameras measure the raw flux of incoming IR radiation, and we perform a calibration procedure to map their readings to absolute temperature values in the range between 40 and 150 \&deg;C. Furthermore, we propose and validate a method to estimate the spatial extent of heat spread created by a cautery tool based on the thermal images.}

This paper will argue how TI can provide supplementary information to existing autonomous detection systems to improve their overall performance. It will outline detection considerations for classifying objects in a thermal image which can later be used in sensor fusion applications. A new labelled dataset of thermal images will also be introduced under snowy, overcast, misty, and nighttime driving conditions. A labeled dataset of a golden retriever and a Doberman will be also be introduced. These datasets are publicly available for download.},

  abstract = {Drones of various types are currently in great demand because of their flexible applications to facilitate human life. At acceptable constant quality levels, they can perform tasks in a repetitive manner. A drone is intended and built in the current work to evaluate the area vulnerable to fire and its surface area at an altitude of 10 meters. In the event of a forest fire disaster, evaluating the impacted area is very complicated. This approach needs to be adaptable and easily controlled in order to solve it. Thus, both the manual and autopilot mode are built and controlled by a quad copter drone with an ardupilot, which drives the drone to the specified location. The drone is fed with the specification of the Global Positioning System ( GPS) and flies with the aid of an ardupilot to the spot. With the aid of a thermal imaging sensor, the drone senses the surface area with its captured image. With the aid of coding dumped in it, the image is sent to the base station and the vision building is achieved with the help of the thermal camera fitted in the front part of the drone and then it interacts with the base station where it is possible to view the surface area. This allows average individuals to recognize the region impacted by the tragedy and to predict the amount of impact they have made in a shorter period of time. Human interference is minimized by this detection method in the areas affected by fire with the extent of fire prediction.},

Given the availability of optical access today's infrared camera systems allow an in-depth understanding of heat transfer processes in hot-gas ducting components of gas turbine engines based on a very detailed analysis of according surface temperatures. Although considerable progress has been achieved in the past, concerning both hardware and software, quantitative infrared analyses still require an in situ calibration. Based on the fundamentals of radiative heat transfer a correction method accounting for the specific boundary conditions accompanied by measurements in hot-gas ducts will be described. Two examples of film cooling investigations, contoured single-hole coolant ejection and full-coverage film cooling, will be presented as typical applications of in situ calibrated infrared thermography.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new portable, ground-based imaging system primarily to investigate the thermal properties of volcanic processes during lava propagation and cooling, although it is potentially applicable to any dynamic geologic process. The miniature multispectral thermal camera (MMT-Cam) is an imaging system that acquires six wavelength bands of thermal infrared (TIR) data between 8 and 12 {$\mu$}m nearly simultaneously. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the camera system are high, 640 {\texttimes} 512 pixels, and 1 s, respectively. The imaging system is calibrated using full-aperture blackbody experiments at a range of temperatures from 283 to 1023 K to account for all instrumental, optical, and transmission effects. In addition, the baseline drift due to changing internal camera temperature is measured and removed. As a result, the accurate multispectral TIR image data are acquired of dynamic surfaces such as propagating and cooling lava flow surfaces captured at the critical temporal (seconds) and thermal (initial rapid cooling) scales. These improved acquisition parameters provide valuable data for both compositional and textural spatiotemporal variability analyses of these volcanic surfaces. Furthermore, the MMT-Cam specifications are designed to be comparable to current and proposed Earth-orbiting TIR instruments to better evaluate the potential for future TIR data sets to deliver similar data sets.},
